"""
The IBM&reg; Speech to Text service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-recognition
capabilities to produce transcripts of spoken audio. The service can transcribe speech
from various languages and audio formats. In addition to basic transcription, the service
can produce detailed information about many different aspects of the audio. For most
languages, the service supports two sampling rates, broadband and narrowband. It returns
all JSON response content in the UTF-8 character set.
For speech recognition, the service supports synchronous and asynchronous HTTP
Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces. It also supports a WebSocket interface
that provides a full-duplex, low-latency communication channel: Clients send requests and
audio to the service and receive results over a single connection asynchronously.
The service also offers two customization interfaces. Use language model customization to
expand the vocabulary of a base model with domain-specific terminology. Use acoustic model
customization to adapt a base model for the acoustic characteristics of your audio. For
language model customization, the service also supports grammars. A grammar is a formal
language specification that lets you restrict the phrases that the service can recognize.
Language model customization is generally available for production use with most supported
languages. Acoustic model customization is beta functionality that is available for all
supported languages.

        Recognize audio.

        Sends audio and returns transcription results for a recognition request. You can
        pass a maximum of 100 MB and a minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a request. The
        service automatically detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for audio
        that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono during
        transcoding. The method returns only final results; to enable interim results, use
        the WebSocket API.
        **See also:** [Making a basic HTTP
        request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html#HTTP-basic).
        ### Streaming mode
         For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the
        `Transfer-Encoding` header to `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode,
        the server closes the connection (status code 408) if the service receives no data
        chunk for 30 seconds and it has no audio to transcribe for 30 seconds. The server
        also closes the connection (status code 400) if no speech is detected for
        `inactivity_timeout` seconds of audio (not processing time); use the
        `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
        **See also:**
        * [Audio
        transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#transmission)
        *
        [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts)
        ### Audio formats (content types)
         The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
        * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type`
        header with the request to specify the format of the audio.
        * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify
        `application/octet-stream` with the header to have the service automatically
        detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify either
        `\"Content-Type:\"` or `\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\"`.)
        Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and
        can optionally include the number of channels and the endianness of the audio.
        * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/flac`
        * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the
        number of channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/mp3`
        * `audio/mpeg`
        * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
        * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
        * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
        The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the
        recognition request: for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models,
        at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than the minimum
        required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the
        sampling rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request
        fails.
         **See also:** [Audio
        formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
        ### Multipart speech recognition
         **Note:** The Watson SDKs do not support multipart speech recognition.
        The HTTP `POST` method of the service also supports multipart speech recognition.
        With multipart requests, you pass all audio data as multipart form data. You
        specify some parameters as request headers and query parameters, but you pass JSON
        metadata as form data to control most aspects of the transcription.
        The multipart approach is intended for use with browsers for which JavaScript is
        disabled or when the parameters used with the request are greater than the 8 KB
        limit imposed by most HTTP servers and proxies. You can encounter this limit, for
        example, if you want to spot a very large number of keywords.
        **See also:** [Making a multipart HTTP
        request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html#HTTP-multi).

        :param file audio: The audio to transcribe.
        :param str content_type: The format (MIME type) of the audio. For more information
        about specifying an audio format, see **Audio formats (content types)** in the
        method description.
        :param str model: The identifier of the model that is to be used for the
        recognition request. See [Languages and
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/models.html).
        :param str language_customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom
        language model that is to be used with the recognition request. The base model of
        the specified custom language model must match the model specified with the
        `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of
        the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is
        used. See [Custom
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
        **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id`
        parameter.
        :param str acoustic_customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom
        acoustic model that is to be used with the recognition request. The base model of
        the specified custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the
        `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of
        the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is
        used. See [Custom
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
        :param str base_model_version: The version of the specified base model that is to
        be used with recognition request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when
        a model is updated for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily
        for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The
        default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom
        model. See [Base model
        version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
        :param float customization_weight: If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a
        custom language model with the recognition request, the customization weight tells
        the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model
        compared to those from the base model for the current request.
        Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was
        specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A
        customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when
        the custom model was trained.
        The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if
        your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when
        setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the
        custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain
        phrases.
        See [Custom
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
        :param int inactivity_timeout: The time in seconds after which, if only silence
        (no speech) is detected in submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400
        error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio submission from a live
        microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity. See
        [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts).
        :param list[str] keywords: An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each
        keyword string can include one or more string tokens. Keywords are spotted only in
        the final results, not in interim hypotheses. If you specify any keywords, you
        must also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords.
        Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords.
        See [Keyword
        spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
        :param float keywords_threshold: A confidence value that is the lower bound for
        spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0.
        If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. The
        service performs no keyword spotting if you omit either parameter. See [Keyword
        spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
        :param int max_alternatives: The maximum number of alternative transcripts that
        the service is to return. By default, the service returns a single transcript. See
        [Maximum
        alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#max_alternatives).
        :param float word_alternatives_threshold: A confidence value that is the lower
        bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as
        \"Confusion Networks\"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0.
        By default, the service computes no alternative words. See [Word
        alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_alternatives).
        :param bool word_confidence: If `true`, the service returns a confidence measure
        in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 for each word. By default, the service returns no word
        confidence scores. See [Word
        confidence](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_confidence).
        :param bool timestamps: If `true`, the service returns time alignment for each
        word. By default, no timestamps are returned. See [Word
        timestamps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_timestamps).
        :param bool profanity_filter: If `true`, the service filters profanity from all
        output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series
        of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with no censoring.
        Applies to US English transcription only. See [Profanity
        filtering](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#profanity_filter).
        :param bool smart_formatting: If `true`, the service converts dates, times, series
        of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into
        more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a
        recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword
        strings to punctuation symbols. By default, the service performs no smart
        formatting.
        **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only.
        See [Smart
        formatting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#smart_formatting).
        :param bool speaker_labels: If `true`, the response includes labels that identify
        which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By
        default, the service returns no speaker labels. Setting `speaker_labels` to `true`
        forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify
        `false` for the parameter.
        **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only. To
        determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, you can also use the
        **Get a model** method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to
        `true`.
        See [Speaker
        labels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels).
        :param str customization_id: **Deprecated.** Use the `language_customization_id`
        parameter to specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that
        is to be used with the recognition request. Do not specify both parameters with a
        request.
        :param str grammar_name: The name of a grammar that is to be used with the
        recognition request. If you specify a grammar, you must also use the
        `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the name of the custom language
        model for which the grammar is defined. The service recognizes only strings that
        are recognized by the specified grammar; it does not recognize other custom words
        from the model's words resource. See
        [Grammars](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html).
        :param bool redaction: If `true`, the service redacts, or masks, numeric data from
        final transcripts. The feature redacts any number that has three or more
        consecutive digits by replacing each digit with an `X` character. It is intended
        to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit card numbers. By default, the
        service performs no redaction.
        When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart formatting,
        regardless of whether you explicitly disable that feature. To ensure maximum
        security, the service also disables keyword spotting (ignores the `keywords` and
        `keywords_threshold` parameters) and returns only a single final transcript
        (forces the `max_alternatives` parameter to be `1`).
        **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Korean transcription only.
        See [Numeric
        redaction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#redaction).
        :param dict headers: A `dict` containing the request headers

        Create a job.

        Creates a job for a new asynchronous recognition request. The job is owned by the
        instance of the service whose credentials are used to create it. How you learn the
        status and results of a job depends on the parameters you include with the job
        creation request:
        * By callback notification: Include the `callback_url` parameter to specify a URL
        to which the service is to send callback notifications when the status of the job
        changes. Optionally, you can also include the `events` and `user_token` parameters
        to subscribe to specific events and to specify a string that is to be included
        with each notification for the job.
        * By polling the service: Omit the `callback_url`, `events`, and `user_token`
        parameters. You must then use the **Check jobs** or **Check a job** methods to
        check the status of the job, using the latter to retrieve the results when the job
        is complete.
        The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. You can poll the service for job
        status or obtain results from the service manually even if you include a callback
        URL. In both cases, you can include the `results_ttl` parameter to specify how
        long the results are to remain available after the job is complete. Using the
        HTTPS **Check a job** method to retrieve results is more secure than receiving
        them via callback notification over HTTP because it provides confidentiality in
        addition to authentication and data integrity.
        The method supports the same basic parameters as other HTTP and WebSocket
        recognition requests. It also supports the following parameters specific to the
        asynchronous interface:
        * `callback_url`
        * `events`
        * `user_token`
        * `results_ttl`
        You can pass a maximum of 100 MB and a minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a
        request. The service automatically detects the endianness of the incoming audio
        and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel
        mono during transcoding. The method returns only final results; to enable interim
        results, use the WebSocket API.
        **See also:** [Creating a
        job](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html#create).
        ### Streaming mode
         For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the
        `Transfer-Encoding` header to `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode,
        the server closes the connection (status code 408) if the service receives no data
        chunk for 30 seconds and it has no audio to transcribe for 30 seconds. The server
        also closes the connection (status code 400) if no speech is detected for
        `inactivity_timeout` seconds of audio (not processing time); use the
        `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
        **See also:**
        * [Audio
        transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#transmission)
        *
        [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts)
        ### Audio formats (content types)
         The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
        * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type`
        header with the request to specify the format of the audio.
        * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify
        `application/octet-stream` with the header to have the service automatically
        detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify either
        `\"Content-Type:\"` or `\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\"`.)
        Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and
        can optionally include the number of channels and the endianness of the audio.
        * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/flac`
        * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the
        number of channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/mp3`
        * `audio/mpeg`
        * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
        * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
        * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
        The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the
        recognition request: for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models,
        at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than the minimum
        required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the
        sampling rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request
        fails.
         **See also:** [Audio
        formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).

        :param file audio: The audio to transcribe.
        :param str content_type: The format (MIME type) of the audio. For more information
        about specifying an audio format, see **Audio formats (content types)** in the
        method description.
        :param str model: The identifier of the model that is to be used for the
        recognition request. See [Languages and
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/models.html).
        :param str callback_url: A URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. The
        URL must already be successfully white-listed by using the **Register a callback**
        method. You can include the same callback URL with any number of job creation
        requests. Omit the parameter to poll the service for job completion and results.
        Use the `user_token` parameter to specify a unique user-specified string with each
        job to differentiate the callback notifications for the jobs.
        :param str events: If the job includes a callback URL, a comma-separated list of
        notification events to which to subscribe. Valid events are
        * `recognitions.started` generates a callback notification when the service begins
        to process the job.
        * `recognitions.completed` generates a callback notification when the job is
        complete. You must use the **Check a job** method to retrieve the results before
        they time out or are deleted.
        * `recognitions.completed_with_results` generates a callback notification when the
        job is complete. The notification includes the results of the request.
        * `recognitions.failed` generates a callback notification if the service
        experiences an error while processing the job.
        The `recognitions.completed` and `recognitions.completed_with_results` events are
        incompatible. You can specify only of the two events.
        If the job includes a callback URL, omit the parameter to subscribe to the default
        events: `recognitions.started`, `recognitions.completed`, and
        `recognitions.failed`. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the
        parameter.
        :param str user_token: If the job includes a callback URL, a user-specified string
        that the service is to include with each callback notification for the job; the
        token allows the user to maintain an internal mapping between jobs and
        notification events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the
        parameter.
        :param int results_ttl: The number of minutes for which the results are to be
        available after the job has finished. If not delivered via a callback, the results
        must be retrieved within this time. Omit the parameter to use a time to live of
        one week. The parameter is valid with or without a callback URL.
        :param str language_customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom
        language model that is to be used with the recognition request. The base model of
        the specified custom language model must match the model specified with the
        `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of
        the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is
        used. See [Custom
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
        **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id`
        parameter.
        :param str acoustic_customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom
        acoustic model that is to be used with the recognition request. The base model of
        the specified custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the
        `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of
        the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is
        used. See [Custom
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
        :param str base_model_version: The version of the specified base model that is to
        be used with recognition request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when
        a model is updated for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily
        for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The
        default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom
        model. See [Base model
        version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
        :param float customization_weight: If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a
        custom language model with the recognition request, the customization weight tells
        the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model
        compared to those from the base model for the current request.
        Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was
        specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A
        customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when
        the custom model was trained.
        The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if
        your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when
        setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the
        custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain
        phrases.
        See [Custom
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom).
        :param int inactivity_timeout: The time in seconds after which, if only silence
        (no speech) is detected in submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400
        error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio submission from a live
        microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity. See
        [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts).
        :param list[str] keywords: An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each
        keyword string can include one or more string tokens. Keywords are spotted only in
        the final results, not in interim hypotheses. If you specify any keywords, you
        must also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords.
        Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords.
        See [Keyword
        spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
        :param float keywords_threshold: A confidence value that is the lower bound for
        spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0.
        If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. The
        service performs no keyword spotting if you omit either parameter. See [Keyword
        spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
        :param int max_alternatives: The maximum number of alternative transcripts that
        the service is to return. By default, the service returns a single transcript. See
        [Maximum
        alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#max_alternatives).
        :param float word_alternatives_threshold: A confidence value that is the lower
        bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as
        \"Confusion Networks\"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0.
        By default, the service computes no alternative words. See [Word
        alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_alternatives).
        :param bool word_confidence: If `true`, the service returns a confidence measure
        in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 for each word. By default, the service returns no word
        confidence scores. See [Word
        confidence](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_confidence).
        :param bool timestamps: If `true`, the service returns time alignment for each
        word. By default, no timestamps are returned. See [Word
        timestamps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_timestamps).
        :param bool profanity_filter: If `true`, the service filters profanity from all
        output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series
        of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with no censoring.
        Applies to US English transcription only. See [Profanity
        filtering](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#profanity_filter).
        :param bool smart_formatting: If `true`, the service converts dates, times, series
        of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into
        more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a
        recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword
        strings to punctuation symbols. By default, the service performs no smart
        formatting.
        **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only.
        See [Smart
        formatting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#smart_formatting).
        :param bool speaker_labels: If `true`, the response includes labels that identify
        which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By
        default, the service returns no speaker labels. Setting `speaker_labels` to `true`
        forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify
        `false` for the parameter.
        **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only. To
        determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, you can also use the
        **Get a model** method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to
        `true`.
        See [Speaker
        labels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels).
        :param str customization_id: **Deprecated.** Use the `language_customization_id`
        parameter to specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that
        is to be used with the recognition request. Do not specify both parameters with a
        request.
        :param str grammar_name: The name of a grammar that is to be used with the
        recognition request. If you specify a grammar, you must also use the
        `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the name of the custom language
        model for which the grammar is defined. The service recognizes only strings that
        are recognized by the specified grammar; it does not recognize other custom words
        from the model's words resource. See
        [Grammars](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html).
        :param bool redaction: If `true`, the service redacts, or masks, numeric data from
        final transcripts. The feature redacts any number that has three or more
        consecutive digits by replacing each digit with an `X` character. It is intended
        to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit card numbers. By default, the
        service performs no redaction.
        When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart formatting,
        regardless of whether you explicitly disable that feature. To ensure maximum
        security, the service also disables keyword spotting (ignores the `keywords` and
        `keywords_threshold` parameters) and returns only a single final transcript
        (forces the `max_alternatives` parameter to be `1`).

        Register a callback.

        Registers a callback URL with the service for use with subsequent asynchronous
        recognition requests. The service attempts to register, or white-list, the
        callback URL if it is not already registered by sending a `GET` request to the
        callback URL. The service passes a random alphanumeric challenge string via the
        `challenge_string` parameter of the request. The request includes an `Accept`
        header that specifies `text/plain` as the required response type.
        To be registered successfully, the callback URL must respond to the `GET` request
        from the service. The response must send status code 200 and must include the
        challenge string in its body. Set the `Content-Type` response header to
        `text/plain`. Upon receiving this response, the service responds to the original
        registration request with response code 201.
        The service sends only a single `GET` request to the callback URL. If the service
        does not receive a reply with a response code of 200 and a body that echoes the
        challenge string sent by the service within five seconds, it does not white-list
        the URL; it instead sends status code 400 in response to the **Register a
        callback** request. If the requested callback URL is already white-listed, the
        service responds to the initial registration request with response code 200.
        If you specify a user secret with the request, the service uses it as a key to
        calculate an HMAC-SHA1 signature of the challenge string in its response to the
        `POST` request. It sends this signature in the `X-Callback-Signature` header of
        its `GET` request to the URL during registration. It also uses the secret to
        calculate a signature over the payload of every callback notification that uses
        the URL. The signature provides authentication and data integrity for HTTP
        communications.
        After you successfully register a callback URL, you can use it with an indefinite
        number of recognition requests. You can register a maximum of 20 callback URLS in
        a one-hour span of time.

        string during URL verification. During verification, the client can also check the
        signature that the service sends in the `X-Callback-Signature` header to verify
        the origin of the request.
        :param str user_secret: A user-specified string that the service uses to generate
        the HMAC-SHA1 signature that it sends via the `X-Callback-Signature` header. The

        The training method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes to

        the current load on the service. The method returns an HTTP 200 response code to
        indicate that the training process has begun.
        You can monitor the status of the training by using the **Get a custom language
        model** method to poll the model's status. Use a loop to check the status every 10
        seconds. The method returns a `LanguageModel` object that includes `status` and
        `progress` fields. A status of `available` means that the custom model is trained
        and ready to use. The service cannot accept subsequent training requests or
        requests to add new resources until the existing request completes.
        Training can fail to start for the following reasons:
        * The service is currently handling another request for the custom model, such as
        another training request or a request to add a corpus or grammar to the model.
        * No training data have been added to the custom model.

        they were extracted from corpora or grammars or were added or modified by the
        user.
        * `user` trains the model only on new words that were added or modified by the
        user directly. The model is not trained on new words extracted from corpora or
        grammars.
        :param float customization_weight: Specifies a customization weight for the custom
        language model. The customization weight tells the service how much weight to give
        to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for
        speech recognition. Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0; the default is 0.3.
        The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if
        your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when
        setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the
        custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain
        phrases.
        The value that you assign is used for all recognition requests that use the model.
        You can override it for any recognition request by specifying a customization
        weight for that request.

        Add a corpus.

        Adds a single corpus text file of new training data to a custom language model.
        Use multiple requests to submit multiple corpus text files. You must use
        credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add a corpus to
        it. Adding a corpus does not affect the custom language model until you train the
        model for the new data by using the **Train a custom language model** method.
        Submit a plain text file that contains sample sentences from the domain of
        interest to enable the service to extract words in context. The more sentences you
        add that represent the context in which speakers use words from the domain, the
        better the service's recognition accuracy.
        The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the corpus is valid. The service
        then asynchronously processes the contents of the corpus and automatically
        extracts new words that it finds. This can take on the order of a minute or two to
        complete depending on the total number of words and the number of new words in the
        corpus, as well as the current load on the service. You cannot submit requests to
        add additional resources to the custom model or to train the model until the
        service's analysis of the corpus for the current request completes. Use the **List
        a corpus** method to check the status of the analysis.
        The service auto-populates the model's words resource with words from the corpus
        that are not found in its base vocabulary. These are referred to as
        out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. You can use the **List custom words** method to
        examine the words resource. You can use other words method to eliminate typos and
        modify how words are pronounced as needed.
        To add a corpus file that has the same name as an existing corpus, set the
        `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails. Overwriting
        an existing corpus causes the service to process the corpus text file and extract
        OOV words anew. Before doing so, it removes any OOV words associated with the
        existing corpus from the model's words resource unless they were also added by
        another corpus or grammar, or they have been modified in some way with the **Add
        custom words** or **Add a custom word** method.
        The service limits the overall amount of data that you can add to a custom model
        to a maximum of 10 million total words from all sources combined. Also, you can
        add no more than 30 thousand custom (OOV) words to a model. This includes words
        that the service extracts from corpora and grammars, and words that you add
        directly.

        :param file corpus_file: A plain text file that contains the training data for the
        corpus. Encode the file in UTF-8 if it contains non-ASCII characters; the service
        assumes UTF-8 encoding if it encounters non-ASCII characters.
        Make sure that you know the character encoding of the file. You must use that
        encoding when working with the words in the custom language model. For more

        Add a custom word.

        Adds a custom word to a custom language model. The service populates the words
        resource for a custom model with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from each corpus or
        grammar that is added to the model. You can use this method to add a word or to
        modify an existing word in the words resource. The words resource for a model can
        contain a maximum of 30 thousand custom (OOV) words. This includes words that the
        service extracts from corpora and grammars and words that you add directly.
        You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add
        or modify a custom word for the model. Adding or modifying a custom word does not
        affect the custom model until you train the model for the new data by using the
        **Train a custom language model** method.
        Use the `word_name` parameter to specify the custom word that is to be added or
        modified. Use the `CustomWord` object to provide one or both of the optional
        `sounds_like` and `display_as` fields for the word.
        * The `sounds_like` field provides an array of one or more pronunciations for the
        word. Use the parameter to specify how the word can be pronounced by users. Use
        the parameter for words that are difficult to pronounce, foreign words, acronyms,
        and so on. For example, you might specify that the word `IEEE` can sound like `i
        triple e`. You can specify a maximum of five sounds-like pronunciations for a
        word.
        * The `display_as` field provides a different way of spelling the word in a
        transcript. Use the parameter when you want the word to appear different from its
        usual representation or from its spelling in training data. For example, you might
        indicate that the word `IBM(trademark)` is to be displayed as `IBM&trade;`.
        If you add a custom word that already exists in the words resource for the custom

        compound words.
        Omit this parameter for the **Add a custom word** method.
        :param list[str] sounds_like: An array of sounds-like pronunciations for the
        custom word. Specify how words that are difficult to pronounce, foreign words,
        acronyms, and so on can be pronounced by users.
        * For a word that is not in the service's base vocabulary, omit the parameter to
        have the service automatically generate a sounds-like pronunciation for the word.
        * For a word that is in the service's base vocabulary, use the parameter to
        specify additional pronunciations for the word. You cannot override the default
        pronunciation of a word; pronunciations you add augment the pronunciation from the
        base vocabulary.
        A word can have at most five sounds-like pronunciations. A pronunciation can

        """
        Add custom words.

        Adds one or more custom words to a custom language model. The service populates
        the words resource for a custom model with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from each
        corpus or grammar that is added to the model. You can use this method to add
        additional words or to modify existing words in the words resource. The words
        resource for a model can contain a maximum of 30 thousand custom (OOV) words. This
        includes words that the service extracts from corpora and grammars and words that
        you add directly.
        You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add
        or modify custom words for the model. Adding or modifying custom words does not
        affect the custom model until you train the model for the new data by using the
        **Train a custom language model** method.
        You add custom words by providing a `CustomWords` object, which is an array of
        `CustomWord` objects, one per word. You must use the object's `word` parameter to
        identify the word that is to be added. You can also provide one or both of the
        optional `sounds_like` and `display_as` fields for each word.
        * The `sounds_like` field provides an array of one or more pronunciations for the
        word. Use the parameter to specify how the word can be pronounced by users. Use
        the parameter for words that are difficult to pronounce, foreign words, acronyms,
        and so on. For example, you might specify that the word `IEEE` can sound like `i
        triple e`. You can specify a maximum of five sounds-like pronunciations for a
        word.
        * The `display_as` field provides a different way of spelling the word in a
        transcript. Use the parameter when you want the word to appear different from its
        usual representation or from its spelling in training data. For example, you might
        indicate that the word `IBM(trademark)` is to be displayed as `IBM&trade;`.
        If you add a custom word that already exists in the words resource for the custom
        model, the new definition overwrites the existing data for the word. If the
        service encounters an error with the input data, it returns a failure code and
        does not add any of the words to the words resource.
        The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the input data is valid. It then
        asynchronously processes the words to add them to the model's words resource. The
        time that it takes for the analysis to complete depends on the number of new words
        that you add but is generally faster than adding a corpus or grammar.
        You can monitor the status of the request by using the **List a custom language
        model** method to poll the model's status. Use a loop to check the status every 10
        seconds. The method returns a `Customization` object that includes a `status`
        field. A status of `ready` means that the words have been added to the custom
        model. The service cannot accept requests to add new data or to train the model
        until the existing request completes.
        You can use the **List custom words** or **List a custom word** method to review
        the words that you add. Words with an invalid `sounds_like` field include an
        `error` field that describes the problem. You can use other words-related methods
        to correct errors, eliminate typos, and modify how words are pronounced as needed.

        Add a grammar.

        Adds a single grammar file to a custom language model. Submit a plain text file in
        UTF-8 format that defines the grammar. Use multiple requests to submit multiple
        grammar files. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns
        a model to add a grammar to it. Adding a grammar does not affect the custom
        language model until you train the model for the new data by using the **Train a
        custom language model** method.
        The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the grammar is valid. The service
        then asynchronously processes the contents of the grammar and automatically
        extracts new words that it finds. This can take a few seconds to complete
        depending on the size and complexity of the grammar, as well as the current load
        on the service. You cannot submit requests to add additional resources to the
        custom model or to train the model until the service's analysis of the grammar for
        the current request completes. Use the **Get a grammar** method to check the
        status of the analysis.
        The service populates the model's words resource with any word that is recognized
        by the grammar that is not found in the model's base vocabulary. These are
        referred to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. You can use the **List custom
        words** method to examine the words resource and use other words-related methods
        to eliminate typos and modify how words are pronounced as needed.
        To add a grammar that has the same name as an existing grammar, set the
        `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails. Overwriting
        an existing grammar causes the service to process the grammar file and extract OOV
        words anew. Before doing so, it removes any OOV words associated with the existing
        grammar from the model's words resource unless they were also added by another
        resource or they have been modified in some way with the **Add custom words** or
        **Add a custom word** method.
        The service limits the overall amount of data that you can add to a custom model
        to a maximum of 10 million total words from all sources combined. Also, you can
        add no more than 30 thousand OOV words to a model. This includes words that the
        service extracts from corpora and grammars and words that you add directly.

        specified by the `Content-Type` header. Encode the file in UTF-8 (ASCII is a
        subset of UTF-8). Using any other encoding can lead to issues when compiling the
        grammar or to unexpected results in decoding. The service ignores an encoding that

        Train a custom acoustic model.

        Initiates the training of a custom acoustic model with new or changed audio
        resources. After adding or deleting audio resources for a custom acoustic model,
        use this method to begin the actual training of the model on the latest audio
        data. The custom acoustic model does not reflect its changed data until you train
        it. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to
        train it.
        The training method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes or hours
        to complete depending on the total amount of audio data on which the custom
        acoustic model is being trained and the current load on the service. Typically,
        training a custom acoustic model takes approximately two to four times the length
        of its audio data. The range of time depends on the model being trained and the
        nature of the audio, such as whether the audio is clean or noisy. The method
        returns an HTTP 200 response code to indicate that the training process has begun.
        You can monitor the status of the training by using the **Get a custom acoustic
        model** method to poll the model's status. Use a loop to check the status once a
        minute. The method returns an `AcousticModel` object that includes `status` and
        `progress` fields. A status of `available` indicates that the custom model is
        trained and ready to use. The service cannot accept subsequent training requests,
        or requests to add new audio resources, until the existing request completes.
        You can use the optional `custom_language_model_id` parameter to specify the GUID
        of a separately created custom language model that is to be used during training.
        Train with a custom language model if you have verbatim transcriptions of the
        audio files that you have added to the custom model or you have either corpora
        (text files) or a list of words that are relevant to the contents of the audio
        files. Both of the custom models must be based on the same version of the same
        base model for training to succeed.
        Training can fail to start for the following reasons:
        * The service is currently handling another request for the custom model, such as
        another training request or a request to add audio resources to the model.
        * The custom model contains less than 10 minutes or more than 100 hours of audio
        data.
        * One or more of the custom model's audio resources is invalid.
        * You passed an incompatible custom language model with the
        `custom_language_model_id` query parameter. Both custom models must be based on
        the same version of the same base model.

        minutes or hours to complete depending on the amount of data in the custom model

        audio resource must be fully complete before you can add another. You must add a
        minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 100 hours of audio that includes speech,
        not just silence, to a custom acoustic model before you can train it. No audio
        resource, audio- or archive-type, can be larger than 100 MB. To add an audio
        resource that has the same name as an existing audio resource, set the
        `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails.
        The method is asynchronous. It can take several seconds to complete depending on
        the duration of the audio and, in the case of an archive file, the total number of
        audio files being processed. The service returns a 201 response code if the audio
        is valid. It then asynchronously analyzes the contents of the audio file or files
        and automatically extracts information about the audio such as its length,
        sampling rate, and encoding. You cannot submit requests to add additional audio
        resources to a custom acoustic model, or to train the model, until the service's
        analysis of all audio files for the current request completes.
        To determine the status of the service's analysis of the audio, use the **Get an
        audio resource** method to poll the status of the audio. The method accepts the
        customization ID of the custom model and the name of the audio resource, and it
        returns the status of the resource. Use a loop to check the status of the audio
        every few seconds until it becomes `ok`.
        **See also:** [Add audio to the custom acoustic
        model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/acoustic-create.html#addAudio).
        ### Content types for audio-type resources
         You can add an individual audio file in any format that the service supports for
        speech recognition. For an audio-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter
        to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the audio file, including specifying
        the sampling rate, channels, and endianness where indicated.
        * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/flac`
        * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of
        channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/mp3`
        * `audio/mpeg`
        * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
        * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
        * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
        The sampling rate of an audio file must match the sampling rate of the base model
        for the custom model: for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband
        models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than the
        minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate.
        If the sampling rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the
        service labels the audio file as `invalid`.
         **See also:** [Audio
        formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
        ### Content types for archive-type resources
         You can add an archive file (**.zip** or **.tar.gz** file) that contains audio
        files in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. For an
        archive-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify the media type
        of the archive file:
        * `application/zip` for a **.zip** file
        * `application/gzip` for a **.tar.gz** file.
        All audio files contained in the archive must have the same audio format. Use the
        `Contained-Content-Type` parameter to specify the format of the contained audio
        files. The parameter accepts all of the audio formats supported for use with
        speech recognition and with the `Content-Type` header, including the `rate`,
        `channels`, and `endianness` parameters that are used with some formats. The
        default contained audio format is `audio/wav`.
        ### Naming restrictions for embedded audio files
         The name of an audio file that is embedded within an archive-type resource must
        meet the following restrictions:
        * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the file name; this includes the file
        extension.
        * Do not include spaces, slashes, or backslashes in the file name.
        * Do not use the name of an audio file that has already been added to the custom
        model as part of an archive-type resource.

        :param str customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of the custom acoustic
        model that is to be used for the request. You must make the request with
        credentials for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
        :param str audio_name: The name of the new audio resource for the custom acoustic
        model. Use a localized name that matches the language of the custom model and
        reflects the contents of the resource.
        * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the name.
        * Do not include spaces, slashes, or backslashes in the name.
        * Do not use the name of an audio resource that has already been added to the
        custom model.
        :param file audio_resource: The audio resource that is to be added to the custom
        acoustic model, an individual audio file or an archive file.
        :param str content_type: For an audio-type resource, the format (MIME type) of the
        audio. For more information, see **Content types for audio-type resources** in the
        method description.
        For an archive-type resource, the media type of the archive file. For more
        information, see **Content types for archive-type resources** in the method
        description.
        :param str contained_content_type: For an archive-type resource, specifies the
        format of the audio files that are contained in the archive file. The parameter
        accepts all of the audio formats that are supported for use with speech
        recognition, including the `rate`, `channels`, and `endianness` parameters that
        are used with some formats. For more information, see **Content types for
        audio-type resources** in the method description.
        :param bool allow_overwrite: If `true`, the specified audio resource overwrites an
        existing audio resource with the same name. If `false`, the request fails if an
        audio resource with the same name already exists. The parameter has no effect if
        an audio resource with the same name does not already exist.
