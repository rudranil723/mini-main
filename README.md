<h2 align="center"> Project MI_NI 2022</h2>

## project description:

- Project built on the principles of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**
- Project mini is an AI development project, the aim is to build an AI named MINI that is capable of receiving input data/ commands both as a sound command or dynamic input, and function accordingly.
  <br>
- I am designing mini to make the userâ€™s life easy, it will be able to do a various range of tasks from performing simple calculations to finding location, searching any information on the web, help the user perform and follow his/her routine, and lots more.
- It runs and is tested on **_windows_** only as of now.
- Initially, I started working on mini keeping in mind the world famous AI **JARVIS** from marvel movies. Itâ€™s my dream to make mini perform like it.
  <br>
  -Thank you for your time.

<br>

**_TO SET UP THE PROJECT_**

- After you download the code file in your local device
- activate the virtual environment
  <br>
  <img src="images/photo1.png">
  <br>
- now use the command **_cd ../.._**
- run the command by typing **_mini.py_** and pressing enter
  <br>
  <img src="images/photo3.png">
  <br>
- enter _1_ to enter **Text command** or enter _2_ for **voice commands**
  <br>
- <h4> when we processed with text input, we decide to run and command the AI with user commands entered from keyword<h4>
  <br>
- you will be asked to enter a password among different wakewords as passwords
  **wakewords = ['mini', 'hey mini', 'hello mini']**
  <br>
  <img align="center" src="images/photo4.png">
  <br>
  - <div><h4>these are the functions _mi_ni_ can perform right now</h4></div>
    <br>
       <img align="center" src="images/photo5.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>And when you enter *2* it initiates the voice control feature, i.e you can use voice commands to run the code and give input </h3>

<br>
<div><h2>when the **mini.py** file runs it calls the **assets/textcommandfuntion.py** which further calls the functions from **text-funtion/ funtions** to perform different functions</h2></div>
