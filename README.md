***Project mini:***
<sub> 
- Project mini is AI development project, the aim is to build a AI named MINI that is capable of receiving input data/ commands both as a sound command or dynamic input, and function accordingly. 
I am designing mini to make the user’s life easy, it will be able to do a various range to task from performing simple calculations to finding location, searing any information on the web, help the user perform and follow his/her routine, and lots more.
It runs and tested on windows only as of now.
Initially, I started working on mini keeping in mind the world famous AI “JARVIS” from marvel movies. It’s my dream to make mini perform like it.
Thank you for your time.
