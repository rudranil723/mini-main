<h2 align="center"> Project MI_NI 2022</h2>

## project description:

- Project build on the principals of **Aritficial Inteligence** and **Machine learning**
- Project mini is AI development project, the aim is to build a AI named MINI that is capable of receiving input data/ commands both as a sound command or dynamic input, and function accordingly.
  <br>
- I am designing mini to make the user’s life easy, it will be able to do a various range to task from performing simple calculations to finding location, searing any information on the web, help the user perform and follow his/her routine, and lots more.
- It runs and tested on **_windows_** only as of now.
- Initially, I started working on mini keeping in mind the world famous AI **JARVIS** from marvel movies. It’s my dream to make mini perform like it.
  <br>
  -Thank you for your time.
